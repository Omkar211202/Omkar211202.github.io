## Introduction:

### History of Strategy:


> [!NOTE] Quote on Strategy
> You may not be able to outsmart others, but you surely can out position them.

- Strategy began with corporate planning, where institutions were more concerned about capital allocation and attainment of 5 year goals. This was in the 1960.
- In 1970's, Oil crisis and Hyper competition led business to find profitable positions in the market despite the surroundings, this phase witnessed the works of Michael Porter, who applied industrial economics to strategy. ("you will read a lot about him in the following page")
- The Resource Based View made organizations believe that its their internal processes, resources and people who gave them leverage.
- The last and recent developments in strategy is the world of digitalization, where change is rampant, a cautious phase for business to await opportunities and take the first mover advantage. This may be termed as Access based view.
### What is Strategy?
- Theme: a unifying theme that gives direction and meaning  to organization in their daily work about steps and decisions they make.
  
- Positioning:
  - a means by which firms compete and achieve a favorable position in their industry.

### Mintzberg 5P's of strategy:

Strategy could be a Plan(course of action), ploy( a specific maneuverer) , pattern (a consistent stream of actions), Position (a firm place in the industry), Perspective (a fundamental way of doing things).

### Misconceptions:

- Strategy is not about org. effectiveness, which is about doing the same things more effectively, strategy is about doing things differently.
- org. effectiveness is easily imitable, thus will not give a long term competitive advantage.

An Analogy:
- Operational effectiveness is about running faster than Usain Bolt, Strategy could be like probably racing him in an F1 car.


> [!Definition] 
> Strategy is about doing different activities than competitors or doing the same activities differently
>  Integrated set of choices that positions a business in its industry to generate superior financial returns over the long run.
> This is likely to create a unique, valuable and sustainable position in the market.


> [!caution]
> Beware Competitors are not only the ones providing same products as you, they are also the one who are interested to solve for the same needs or wants.

Though, we may fathom or think that only one core strength can give competitive advantage, no, sometimes a set of activities interlock with each other to give a strategic advantage.

The case of South West airlines where they cut down the price of tickets, did not serve meals on the plane, the seats were sleek, only short distance flights were available etc. are but illustrations to show that the series of activities taken to run the low cost carrier.

The following are few strategic positions in the open market:
- variety based: focus only on a small niche in the market place. (MRF Tyers)
- Needs based: providing the product for only a type of customers and not for all. (Gita press)
- access based: trying to reach people who are generally not tapped by the large players. (Starlink)

How is strategy made??
- Intended strategy: Following the plan, top down approach, rational, in the purpose
- emergent strategy: unplanned actions, learning, adaptation from deep within the org.
- Henry Minzberg's view: formulation and implementation are intertwined.
- True strategy is mix of intended and emergent strategy.

Strategy also answers two prominent questions:
1. Where to compete: the business landscape
2. how should we compete: business model and positioning

Objective of strategy is to:
1. create a competitive advantage that is sustainable and superior.
2. Create a premium that is the gap between what people are willing the pay vs the cost of product.
3. should lead to superior and sustainable financial performance

An org. should be aware of its external consistency, opportunities available and internal consistency.

Framework 1: Porters Six forces model.

Business Model:
The way or structure by which businesses operate to create and capture value.

Value proposition: Differentiation and low cost.
Target market: broad or narrow (focus).

Good strategy;
- diagnosis of competitive challenge
- guiding policy to address the competitive challenge
- set of coherent actions to implement the firm's guiding policy

Balanced score card

- Financials, customers, Internal, Learning and growth

Objectives and key results:
A plan started by IBM where:
- objectives are qualitatively expressed and key results are measured using metrics.

Threats of strategy:
1. Imitation
2. Substitution
3. Holdup
4. Adaption of trends due to Perception, Motivation, Inspiration, Coordination.

## Strategic Leadership:

- As known from earlier, the lessons from strategy indicate: ROIC (superior performance) and competitive advantage.
- Profits and growth are determined by 2 factors: industry performance in the market and success of the individual company in the industry space.
- Though profit is metric for a business org, for an NGO and Govt. org its gonna be the impact they have in their space
- Levels of strategy start with head office, business level offices and functional level managers.

### The Process:
- set up the vision, mission and values.
- identify opportunities and threats ( via internal an external analysis)
- analyze the strength and weaknesses.
- make strategies that combat weakness, leverage strength and opportunities aligning with vision and mission
- implement strategies.

Leadership: effectively manages strategy making
Formulation: determining and selecting strategies
Implementation: put strategies into action and improve efficiency and effectiveness

Types of strategies:
- Corporate level strategy: 
1. Diversification
2. Vertical integration
3. consolidation
4. Geographic expansion

- Business level strategy: Cost leadership, Differentiation, and focus.
- Functional strategy looks forth to find the best course of action to be taken to ensure that org. goals are attained.

| unequal access to distribution channels |                                                                            | switching costs                                            |                                                                 |                                                      |
| Restrictive govt  policy                |                                                                            |                                                            |                                                                 |                                                      |
Porter adds that the 6th factor is power of complementors: a group of activities or companies that can add value to one another.

What makes an industry?
- A group of products and services that are perceived by customers as meeting the same need.
- Thus, each industry will have a set of competitors, substitutes etc.
- These boundaries of what comprises  the industry will change over time due to the innovation that is taking place in the ecosystem.
- Thus, industry is tool for understanding how profits are distributed among market participants.
- Porter 5 force analysis will help in understanding how industry analysis is done.
- Six steps in industry analysis: Define, Identify, Analyze, test, respond and change.

Strategic groups within an industry: 
- though these groups offer to solve the same problem or need or want, they may do it differently by their activities of business models, they thus form strategic groups.
- They may vary in terms of the target audience, distribution channels, pricing, technology adoption and customer focus.
- These groups are often identified by the similar features they possess.

When an industry is building or evolving, the following stages may be observed:
- Embryonic
- Growth
- Shakeout
- Mature
- decline.

The following phases are also highlighted in the BCG matrix.

## Internal Analysis

- firm strength that helps the company to differentiate its products or achieve substantially lower costs for competitive advantage.
- Apple is known for its design, giving it competitive advantage.
- Distinctive competencies are not copied easily given its complex nature or IP rights.

Framework VRIO:
- valuable: create strong demand for its products, lower the cost of products
- rarity: non common and rival has no access to them
- Inimitable: they are hard to copy ( can be due to path dependence, casual ambiguity, social complexity and IP)
- organized: the structure of the org is made apt to create and capture the value.

Framework Porter Value chain analysis classifies a company based on primary and supporting activities. The following is a classic Value chain analysis for Zee entertainment.

![[Screenshot 2025-10-25 204710.png]]

What makes the company have a strategic advantage:
- superior quality: excellence and reliability
- superior customer responsiveness: customer response time and service provided to him.
- superior innovation: product innovation or process innovation
- superior efficiency: employee productivity or capital productivity.

Difference between Resources, capabilities and competencies:

| Resources                                 | Capabilities                                                                                   | Competencies                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| foundational assets with the organization | deploy or coordinate its resources to achieve a desired outcome, can be termed as exploitation | cross functional integration of capabilities, making all depts function to deliver that capability. |

How to identify a core competency:
- This is  the best skill or knowledge a companies has given its existence for a long time and it will position the company as the best spot in this regard.

Advantages of core competency:
- gives access to a variety of markets
- makes a significant contribution to perceived customer benefits of the end product.
- difficult for competitors to imitate.

Porters value chain analysis:
- Primary: Inward logistics, production, outbound logistics, services and sales and marketing.
- Secondary: procurement, technology, infrastructure, and HRM.

Business Model:
A Business model is a collection all things that are concerning a company from Key activities, Key Partnerships, Key resources, Value proposition, channels, Customer relationships, customer segments. They also list down all the Costs and Revenues wrt to  the company. The following is an example of Business Model canvas of Zee Entertainment:

![[Screenshot 2025-10-25 205638.png]]

Framework for growth: (ansoff matrix)
- leverage existing core competencies for the old markets
- build new core competencies for the old markets
- put old competencies in new markets
- build for new markets

## Functional and Business level Strategy:

- Strategy in an organization works at multiple levels, starting off with the top level management making the top decisions, where the company will participate and in which industries, the mid level management will make decisions on how to participate product differentiation or focus based approach.
- The functional level exists to implement the strategy.

The business level strategy in a firm is done to determine a strategic position in the industry, where gap between the perceived and cost value is at its maxima. According to porter this can be done in two  ways:

| Basis                | Cost Leadership                                                        | Differentiation                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal                 | to produce at the cheapest cost                                        | to produce superior products for a target group that is unique         |
| advantage            | operational efficiency, economies of scale, process innovation         | superior product featurs, brand image, customer service and innovation |
| key value chain act. | opeartions, supply chain, process engineering                          | Research  and dev, marketing and sales, customer service               |
| products/ services   | standardised, no frills and acceptable quality                         | unique features, high quality and premium branding.                    |
| key risks            | imitation to reach the lowest cost makes investments void or nullified | imitation of the unique feature, changes in customer taste.            |

Functional level strategy:
- developing and coordinating resources in a firm to achieve the strategic goals in a firm with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
- Modes of achieving functional excellence: superior efficiency, quality, innovation and customer responsiveness.

1. Superior efficiency (cost advantage): take care of cost side of the equation
- operations management: using modern operation techniques like six sigma, JIT, reduce wastage and maxima productivity.
- supply chain logistics: ensuring optimal mode of transportation to minimize storage and costs of the same.
- process engineering: making continuous improvements to ensure the process is better and efficient.

2. Quality and innovation: take care of the price side of the equation since better product
- Research and development, marketing and sales, HRM.

3. Customer Service:  fosters loyalty and price sensitivity, 
- marketing, customer service.

Platform Based Models:
- Prior to  digitalization, things happened more like a pipeline fashion, but digitalization has improved both awareness and accessibility to lots of things. This brings in the Platform based models like Zomato, Amazon, Ott's etc.
- Platform based models do not create a direct value themselves, but they foster value creation via providing a platform for the interaction of many sellers and buyers.

here are a few set of key differences between them:

| basis               | Pipeline Model                                               | Platform Based Model                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value Creation      | Linear fashion: step by step                                 | network process: facilitates value exchange between users.                       |
| Key asset           | physical assets, inventory                                   | network of users.                                                                |
| Scale of economies  | supply side of economies, reduction in the cost of products. | demand side of economies of scale, create a good demand for products via network |
| competitive dynamic | Market share thorugh cost differentiation                    | create a self network and making he new standard.                                |
| primary goal        | optimmise the internal value of chain                        | max value of interactions with in the ecosystem.                                 |

Two side markets and network externalities:
- A platform based approach where the firm acts as intermediary between both the parties in business, thus must ensure that there are enough number of buyers and sellers on the platform, a substantial reduction even of one of the parties could hamper the business model.
All platform businesses aim for a take it all approach, trying to capture the entire ecosystem at a tipping point.

Business ecosystems:
- Two sided markets diversify into related products or services to offer more to the customers, making the entire system an ecosystem.
- Zomato went out to form district etc., which is not the core aspect of Zomato.

## Strategy & Innovation

- Innovation was limited to peripheral growth in business, but over time it has become a day to day prominent part of the business work. It helps to find advantage, outline market changing activities etc.
- Innovation lies in enhancing the firm's ability to create economic value.
- it either increasing perceived value and decreasing cost.
- Ambidextrous can be viewed into two forms: the defensive exploitation (making the best of current state) and offensive exploration (looking for better business avenues).

Clayton Christensen's Disruptive Innovation:
- A process by where new comers challenge the incumbents by finding gaps in the market to build their niche. This can be done by the following:
- Low end Disruptions: reaching out the non premium market segment.
- new market disruption: create new product by delivering a service or product in a different a way, this is generally triggered by a change in technology.

Innovator Dilemma:
- The problem faced by the incumbent whether to find significant importance in the newcomer and his way of doing things or to believe in way of doing things.
- This is generally faced when new technology poses threat to existing technological sunk costs.

This is how Innovative Innovation happens:

[[Disruptive Innovation.excalidraw]]

Blue Ocean Strategy:
- Trying to play in the untapped market spaces, this is known as blue oceans, the fully played market is often considered as the red ocean (you can bleed if you play out there).
- The red ocean could be the old market, where there are fully laid rules of functioning and conducting businesses.
- This could possibly lead to creating new markets as you will innovate to solve the same need faced by the customer in a new and different manner.

The Four Actions Framework:
Lets say I'm Gillette and I'm trying to enter the then existing markets the following is the way i would probably build my blue ocean strategy:

| Eliminate                                  | Reduce                         | Raise                                | Create                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| - usage of non clean and dangerous blades. | - wastage of blades and frames | - better designed blades and frames  | - lotions, aftershaves,                     |
| - uneasiness faced while shaving.          | - injuries while shaving       | - easily usable grooming accessories | - other grooming accessories and ecosystem. |
| - bad designed frames                      |                                |                                      |                                             |
Refer to strategy canvas development on the internet, a prominent framework or tool in Blue ocean strategy.

## Global Strategy Leadership

- Porter Diamond model is the first model to analyze a new environment / new country to run an enterprise.
- it considers the following: Intensity of rivalry, Local demand, competitiveness of related and supporting industries, and factor conditions.

- An yet another model to consider the distance between places and products is the CAGE model which analyses the cultural, administrative, geographic and economic conditions for functioning in another country.

- Two diemensions of the Diamond model may considered: 1. Pressure for cost reductions and pressure for local responsiveness, and the following strategies may be evolved:


| Cost Reduction/Local responsiveness | low                             | high                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| high                                | standard globalization strategy | transnational strategy |
| low                                 | International strategy          | Localization strategy  |
