## Introduction to  Group Dynamics:


- Group Dynamics in Indian Context: Influence of Indian culture, hierarchy, and collectivistic mentality on group dynamics.

Groups have been very close to human life on earth, be it our ancestors, who wandered in groups, build small kingdoms, legislative bodies or even kingdoms. The very human life needs us to be part of groups, small like our families, large like the places we work. Being in a group makes our behavior change, shapes our psychology and the way we learn.

That's the reason a great man said: "Tell me your company, I shall tell who you really are?"

Groups are even common in animals: that's why we say a school of fish, mob of kangaroo, murder of crows, gam of whales.

> [!NOTE] Definition
> Two or more individuals connected by and within a social relationship
> 

The Break down of the definition:
- Two or more individuals:  groups can be either dyads, triads or even include more number of people. (Simmel 1902).
- However, if there is only one person, it no longer is a group.
- Connected: link that gets members together. Superficial similarities need necessitate  the formation of a group.
- they may be connected to  each other in meaningful ways.
- by and within social relations: relations could be of myriad nature: conflicts, harmony etc. but none the less, they all link the members in a social setting via a bonding.


Types of Groups:

| Primary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Secondary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - very small groups, tightly knit, influence the other for a lot of time, closeness and physical proximity, like families, clusters, cliques form a primary group. Even when distant from the group, this is still a part of his identity, this group shapes the behavior of the individual. | - less intimate, shorter duration and lesser emotion binding, work oriented in general.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Collectives: people coming together for a purpose for a very small time, typically a gathering of mob, strikes all of them having a common interest.                                                                                                                                         | Categories: collection of individuals who are similar to one another in some way. The commonness they have may termed as social identity.<br>Build stereotypes to put down people, not part of their group. An example of this is: racism. |
- Groups may be more than the sum of their individual parts but each part defines the whole (Mooreland, 2013).

- Characteristics of a group: 
1. Composition: People in a group are different kinds of individuals by nature, yet they come together may be to  achieve a common goal.
2. boundaries: they define who is part of a group and who cannot the part of the group. Open groups are easy to enter and exit, but closed groups like secret services etc., will not allow random people to get in.
3. Size: As said earlier, groups range from dyads to lots of people. Small groups are likely to have more strong connections as to large groups, thus we may observe disintegration of large groups. the total possible interactions in a group may include: $n*(n+1)/2$ connections. Its impossible for a group more than 150 individuals to have unique connections among all its members.
4. Interaction: there are two types of groups based on infinite type of interaction that may be possible: focused groups and other groups, but its possible these groups as well as to have emotional bonding.
5. Interdependence: Interdependence is likely to depend on the type of group, some groups allow dependency among members, also do not. They may be structures in terms of symmetricity, hierarchy and reciprocity
6. Structure: Groups may be structured or unstructured, and members collect into subgroups to exert pressure on the entirety. Hierarchy may help and equally hurt the group performance.
7. Goals: Human goals are short term and not long term given the survival mode on, so may be group goals with no proper plan. Mc Grath advocated: generating, choosing, negotiating, executing.
8. Unity: cohesiveness is dependent on how members identify themselves with  the group's goals and not the social bonds that exist among the members.
9. Entitavity: How does a person feel about the group looking at it as a stranger? Can he discover it as a group or not?? Perspective for an outsider. Proximity may be signal of Entitativity.
10. Origin: Planned groups - created using a proper structure, rules, purposes etc. may be by an individual within the group (Founded) or someone outside(Concocted) the group, they may also emerge on their own (Circumstantial) due to a scenario or due to repeated aligned interaction of people (Self organizing groups).

Group dynamics are the interpersonal processes that occur in and between groups over time,
including the following:
- Formative processes, such as the need to belong to and affiliate in groups, contextual factors that promote the formation of groups, and the development of group cohesion.
- Influence processes, including aspects of group structure (norms, roles, relationships), conformity and dissent, social power, obedience to group authority, and leadership.
- Performance processes, such as group productivity, social motivation, working in teams, and collaborative decision making.
- Conflict processes within groups—intragroup conflict—and between groups—intergroup conflict.
 - Contextual processes that are dependent on the group’s physical setting and specific purpose, including change-promoting groups and large collectives.

Why Group Dynamics:
- Groups can influence individuals and GD scientifically studies this part.
- Fundamental Attribution error
- can alter individuals attitudes
- influence society at large.
- Humans live in groups and as mere individuals.

Principles/ Reasons for Group Formation:
- Proximity
- Similarity
- Common Goals
- Need Satisfaction
- Organizational Requirements

- FIRO B and Johari 
- Indian Context: collectivist, power distance.

## Understanding Group Structure:
- Norms and Roles in Groups: How group norms evolve and influence group behavior and performance, Understanding different roles in teams.
- Inter-member Relations in Groups: How status relations, attraction relations and communication relations affect group behavior and performance.
- Influence of Indian Social Structures: The role of caste, community, and family in shaping group roles, group norms and group behavior.
- Experiential Learning / Hands-on Component: Group activity which involves assigning and analyzing team member roles in practical scenarios or in case studies based on member strengths and team objectives.

What are Norms?
- Norms are informal guidelines in a group, they are not stated explicitly at any place but are to followed and known by various interactions with in the groups, not following them will lead non acceptance at the group.
- Norms develop organically, with in the group ducting the normative and forming stages. They develop based on the former members work culture etc. For example. if lots people in the work place come from the formal culture, they instill the same culture at work, at start-ups it generally is the other way round.
- Sometimes they develop during critical events. Suppose on a given day if an employee committed a mistake and the members offered support and safety, safety becomes a norm, if the dissent at him, then no mistakes becomes the norm.
- Norms grow top down based not  on what leaders say, but what they practice.

Types of Norms:

- Prescriptive: norms that identify preferable and positive behaviors.
- Proscriptive: norms that identify prohibited and negatively sanctioned behaviors.
- Descriptive: norms that typically confirm how people act, behave or feel during situations.
- Injunctive: norms that educate on how people should act, behave or feel during certain situations.

Social Tuning:
- adjusting to how society reacts to events without being explicitly being told.


- Performance Norms: this sets how the work is done in an organization, do organizations expect individuals to work too hard or to just do enough work. These norms also guide how much effort an individual should put at work, whether he should work hard or no. Norms are guiding forces even when work based pay is set, working too hard could lead to a bad image in the group or can lead to loss of job.

- Appearance Norms: these starts off with how to address the people in a group, the way you probably call them, by their first name or last name etc. It runs through how the persons clothes should be, too formal or even the acceptance of casuals.

- Communication Norms: norms about how to communicate, with whom communication is accepted and with whom you are not supposed to directly talk. how to address people, formality of communication, channels of communication, openness of communication, patterns of communication.

- Social arrangement norms:  who interacts with whom, how much social space must be present among workers in the organization, whether people can meet outside the workplace, different levels of hierarchy etc.

- Resource allocation norms: norms govern how the groups resources including money, time, equipment, space and opportunities are distributed among members, whether it is equity, equality, and other principles. These norms profoundly affect perceptions of fairness within the group.

How norms shape Group behavior and performance:
- reduce uncertainty and set clear protocol.
- coordination by ensuring behavioral predictability.
- norms create accountability through social pressure.
- group identity and culture.

Roles: 
Roles are formal designations given to people with aforesaid responsibilities and authority, a person in a role is expected to follow the role assigned to him, meaning he has a job description or a project charter to  execute.
however, informal roles do exist only when an individual searches for the same and are equally important.

- Task roles: initiator, information seeker, information giver, opinion giver, elaborator, coordinator, orienteer, evaluator / critic, energizer, recorder,
- Relationships: encourager, harmonizer, compromiser, gatekeeper, standard setter, observer and commentator.
- Individual: aggressor, blocker, recognition seeker, self confessor, playboy, dominator, help seeker, special interest pleader.

- Task and relationship based roles.
- Differentiation in roles.

Role ambiguity: arises when people occupying the role as to if he is performing the role in the right manner or not.
Role stress: stress coming from an unimportant disinterested role , with not much work or talent required, basically not challenging.
Role conflict: When one individual is assigned with multiple roles of different nature, which probably asks him to think differently based on the shoe he wears at that point in time.
Interrole Conflict: if an individual occupies multiple roles, there may be a case when he occupies one role that asks him to something  else other then what the other role may want to him do.
Intrarole conflict: inconsistency in what the role wants you do but difference in what other expect from the role.
Person role  conflict: difference between the person's skills and attitudes as compared to work assigned to him, he is not role fit.

Status:
- Inter relational aspect dictating power, authority, rank, importance and prestige.
- Bases of :
- Formal:
- Expertise and competence:
- External status:
- seniority:
- Personal characteristics:

Social Influence:



Status Relations:
Status differentiation:
Status rank:

Sociometric differentiation:

Communication Relations: the pattern of exchange of information in a group may be termed as communication relationships.

Some aspects of social networks:
Degree centrality: number of ties between group members, average of the direct communications.
closeness:  The inverse  of the distance, in terms of ties of an individual from all others in the network.
Indegree: ties received by the individual in a directed network
Outdegree: ties initiated by the individual in a directed network
Indegree: number off ties received by the individual in a directed network.
Density: how many people are linked to the other.
clique: clusters within a group.
Holes: disconnections between non redundant connections in a network.

Evolution from Group to Team:
- small number of highly committed individuals with complementary skills are interdependent and have a deep sense of shared purpose, set ambitious performance goals and have a complete approach for achieving those goals for which they hold themselves mutually and collectively accountable.

## Power and Influence in Groups and Teams:

- Power in Groups: Bases of power within a group and how they affect group performance, Why do people (sometimes illogically) obey someone in authority – Milgram’s experiment.
- Team Leadership: The impact of leadership styles (authoritative, democratic, laissez-faire, etc) on team effectiveness, How organizational culture affects leadership in teams, How leadership bridges cultural differences in teams.
- Experiential Learning / Hands-on Component: Leadership role-play exercises and group activity where students experience power and influence in groups. Discussion of videos/movies to understand the power and influence of one-to-many and many-to-one.

Majority Influence:
Social pressure exerted by the larger portion of a group (the majority), directed toward individual members and smaller factions within the group (the minority).

Minority Influence:
Social pressure exerted by a lone individual or smaller faction of a group (the minority), directed toward members of the majority.

Aash's experiment:

Conformity:
A change in one’s actions, emotions, opinions, judgments, and so on that reduces their discrepancy with these same types of responses displayed by others.

Types of conformity:
1. Compliance
2. Conversion:
3. Convergence:

Types of non conformity:
- independence
- anti conformity:
- strategic anti conformity:

Minority influence:
- validation vs comparison:
- Delayed social influence:
- Consistency and influence:

Sources of  Influence:
implicit influence Unlike explicit, consciously recognized social influence, unnoticed and largely automatic cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions to other people. Example: Mindlessness.

informational influence Change-promoting interpersonal processes that are based on the informational value of the responses of others in the situation. Example: false consensus effect, dual process theories.

normative influence Change-promoting interpersonal processes based on social norms, standards, and convention. Because individuals internalize their group’s norms, they strive to act in ways that are consistent with those norms.

interpersonal influence: Change-promoting interpersonal processes based on group members selectively encouraging conformity and discouraging or even pun shing non conformity.

- Power in Groups: Bases of power within a group and how they affect group performance, Why do people (sometimes illogically) obey someone in authority – Milgram’s experiment.

Bases of Power:
- Reward power:
- Coercive power:
- Legitimate power:
- Referent power:
- Expert power:
- Informational power:

Miligram's Experiment:
- promixity and surveillance 
- perstige and legitimacy:

## ## Conflict Resolution:

- The Process by which individuals or group perceive that others have taken some action that has a negative effect on their interest.
- Disagreement, discord, and friction that occur when the actions or beliefs of one or more members of the group are unacceptable to and resisted by one or more of the other group members.

Misconceptions about Conflict and Conflict Resolution:
- Conflict is bad and should be avoided
- All conflicts can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction
- its a zero sum game world
- approach negotiations as adversaries
- restrict communication during negotiation

Generic Types of Conflict:
- Intra group conflict;
- Inter Group conflict:
- cooperation:
- competition:
- mixed motive situation:
- prisoner's dilemma game:
- behavioral assimilation:

Course of Conflict:
- Routine Group interaction : Conflict : Conflict Escalation : Conflict Resolution : Routine Group Interaction.

- No Conflict (domineering leader) or too much conflict

Sources of Conflict:
healthy sources:
- focused on task or work related issues
- legitimate differences or opinions perspectives or values
- expectations about impact of decisions may vary
- devil's advocate / anti conformity

Unhealthy sources of conflict:
- Compromise on core values of mission
- bad leadership
- fight for power and scarce resources and rewards
- Blame game
- Bullying, discrimination or harassment based on gender, age , disability, religion, or national origin.
- Ambiguities over responsibilities
- status differences among team members
- non alignment of individual and team / org. goals
- faulty communication
- personal grudges from past experiences
- hidden agendas or pre conceived notions

Impact of Productive Conflict
- motivates to think differently, understand each other, not ignore and make better decision keeping in place other alternatives.

Impact  of unproductive conflict:
- negative emotions and stress, can reduce or even destroy team cohesion, can affect or damage team cohesion, damage social relations, winners and looses who can be a source of conflict in the future.
- coercive leadership, stereotyping, increase in conformity.
- can result in disastrous outcomes if conflicts are not resolved.

Types of Conflict
- task
- relationship conflict
- Task conflict can easily morph into relationship conflict

Procedural Justice:
- fairness of the process to make decisions, not just the outcomes
- Characteristics: Consistency, Bias suppression, Accuracy, Correctability, Representativeness, Ethicality.

Thomas Kilmann Model of conflict resolution:

| Assertive/ Cooperative | Low       | High          |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| High                   | Competing | Collaboration |
| Low                    | Avoiding  | Accomodating  |
Cooperative vs Assertive

Steps of ADT: Mediation Conciliation and Arbitration

Emotional quotient in regulating conflicts:
Self awareness, Self regulate, empathy, social skills

## Decision makin in Groups and Teams:

- Decision-Making in Groups: ODDI model of group decision-making, Different types of decision-making in groups/teams (averaging, voting, consensus building, and delegating), Other types of decision-making models for making complex decisions (Vroom’s Normative Model, Vroom-Yetton Decision Model), Problem solving techniques (Brainstorming, Nominal Group Technique, and Delphi).
- Decisional Biases in Decision-Making: Types of decisional biases (judgmental and cognitive biases, shared information bias, group polarization) and how these biases lead to faulty decisions.
- Managing Groupthink: Definition and significance of groupthink in affecting decision-making, Causes of groupthink and how to prevent groupthink.
- AI in Decision making
- Experiential Learning / Hands-on Component: Group decision-making simulations/activities which focuses on different types of group decision-making and students experience first-hand different decisional biases and how to avoid them.

- The most commonly faced challenges for making decisions:
—taking costly steps to defend against unlikely outcomes. Others are overconfident—underestimating the range of potential outcomes. And still others are highly impression able—allowing memorable events in the past to dictate their view of what might be possible now.

Most of the decision making happens through unconscious routes: heuristics.


Common Traps in decision making:
- The Anchoring Trap: Based on our past knowledge or interactions, we use it to decision making.
- Use of different perspectives to  the problem is necessary.
- Have say first by yourself, before getting anchored on to others judgements.
- Be Open minded and know all different viewpoints and look for fresh directions.
- Beware of Anchors tried by others in negotiation and you may also use anchors to your advantage.

- The Status Quo Trap: People feel that they are unbiased and rationale.
- Example: People not selling shares they inherited, because they are comfortable not thinking about thg.
- The World punishes people doing something wrong (Sins of commission) rather than people doing nothing (Sins of omission), backed by status quo.
- Do not choose status quo to be comfortable.
- Keep the objectives in mind and examine how they would be served by maintaining status quo
- Alternate options with cost and benefits
- Do not exaggerate the effort or cost to switch from status quo
- Force yourself to choose the best.

- The Sunk Cost Trap:
- We always to try to justify some actions of the past even when they are invalid.
- Commonly seen in banking where the bank lends more money to help a failing business to which already loans have been given, hoping for a better future.
- “When you find yourself in a hole, the best thing you can do is stop digging.”
- Avoid thinking about the sunk costs and its effects.
- Reassign responsibilities to others overtime to avoid sunk cost biases.
- No fear failing company or culture.

- The Conforming Evidence Trap:



- The Framing Trap



- The Estimating and Forecasting Traps


- The Recallability Trap:




Problems:
- Not able to define the alternatives.
- Cost, benefits and information

## Vroom Yetton Jago Decision Model:

- This model is based on situational leadership, that can be used by all cadres of positions in an organization
- One common question is should the leader take the decision or the group be involved in the decision process.
- The is test or model helps the user in choosing a binomial output for a series of questions asked in a matrix, giving him insights on the leadership style and decisions to be made.
- Three important factors: Quality, collaboration and time.
- Contributions by Victor Vroom and Phillip Willian Yetton and supplementations by Arthur Jago.

1. the Quality of the Decision: Impact of the decision and the need to find the right solution.
2. Involvement and Collab: important for everyone is the decision
3. Time: How much time is there to make the dections.

Styles of Decision Making:


| Basis | Autocratic I                    | Autocratic II                                                                  | Consultative I                            | Consultative 2                                                                | Group 2                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       | leader alone makes the decision | Leader makes the decision                                                      | Leader alone makes the decision.          | Leader alone makes the decision                                               | group makes the decision                                               |
|       | No consultation of team members | Info is gathered from the members informally with no explicit mention of test. | All express their opinions to the leader. | All express opinions individually and there is group discussion for the same. | Leader presents the case, alternative formulation and aid the process. |
|       | Open and Clear communication    |                                                                                |                                           |                                                                               |                                                                        |
|       |                                 |                                                                                |                                           |                                                                               |                                                                        |

Determining the Right Style:
- Quality Requirement: QR:  how significant and impact of the decision to make the decision.
- Commitment Requirement: CR: successful result dependent upon the team members
- Leaders information: LI:
- Commitment probability: CP :
- Goal Congruence: GC :
- Subordinate conflicts: CO:
- Subordinate information: SI:
