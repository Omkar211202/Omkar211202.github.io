## Decision Making:
- The most commonly faced challenges for making decisions:
—taking costly steps to defend against unlikely outcomes. Others are overconfident—underestimating the range of potential outcomes. And still others are highly impression able—allowing memorable events in the past to dictate their view of what might be possible now.

Most of the decision making happens through unconscious routes: heuristics.


Common Traps in decision making:
- The Anchoring Trap: Based on our past knowledge or interactions, we use it to decision making.
- Use of different perspectives to  the problem is necessary.
- Have say first by yourself, before getting anchored on to others judgements.
- Be Open minded and know all different viewpoints and look for fresh directions.
- Beware of Anchors tried by others in negotiation and you may also use anchors to your advantage.

- The Status Quo Trap: People feel that they are unbiased and rationale.
- Example: People not selling shares they inherited, because they are comfortable not thinking about them.
- The World punishes people doing something wrong (Sins of commission) rather than people doing nothing (Sins of omission), backed by status quo.
- Do not choose status quo to be comfortable.
- Keep the objectives in mind and examine how they would be served by maintaining status quo
- Alternate options with cost and benefits
- Do not exaggerate the effort or cost to switch from status quo
- Force yourself to choose the best.

- The Sunk Cost Trap:
- We always to try to justify some actions of the past even when they are invalid.
- Commonly seen in banking where the bank lends more money to help a failing business to which already loans have been given, hoping for a better future.
- “When you find yourself in a hole, the best thing you can do is stop digging.”
- Avoid thinking about the sunk costs and its effects.
- Reassign responsibilities to others overtime to avoid sunk cost biases.
- No fear failing company or culture.

- The Conforming Evidence Trap:



- The Framing Trap



- The Estimating and Forecasting Traps


- The Recallability Trap:
- 




Problems:
- Not able to define the alternatives.
- Cost, benefits and information is not correctly obtained.

Techniques:
- Try to reframe the questions hitting your brain...

Vroom Yetton Jago Decision Model:

- This model is based on situational leadership, that can be used by all cadres of positions in an organization
- One common question is should the leader take the decision or the group be involved in the decision process.
- The is test or model helps the user in choosing a binomial output for a series of questions asked in a matrix, giving him insights on the leadership style and decisions to be made.
- Three important factors: Quality, collaboration and time.
- Contributions by Victor Vroom and Phillip Willian Yetton and supplementations by Arthur Jago.

1. the Quality of the Decision: Impact of the decision and the need to find the right solution.
2. Involvement and Collab: important for everyone is the decision
3. Time: How much time is there to make the dections.

Styles of Decision Making:


| Basis | Autocratic I                    | Autocratic II                                                                  | Consultative I                            | Consultative 2                                                                | Group 2                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       | leader alone makes the decision | Leader makes the decision                                                      | Leader alone makes the decision.          | Leader alone makes the decision                                               | group makes the decision                                               |
|       | No consultation of team members | Info is gathered from the members informally with no explicit mention of test. | All express their opinions to the leader. | All express opinions individually and there is group discussion for the same. | Leader presents the case, alternative formulation and aid the process. |
|       | Open and Clear communication    |                                                                                |                                           |                                                                               |                                                                        |

Determining the Right Style:
- Quality Requirement: QR:  how significant and impact of the decision to make the decision.
- Commitment Requirement: CR: successful result dependent upon the team members
- Leaders information: LI:
- Commitment probability: CP :
- Goal Congruence: GC :
- Subordinate conflicts: CO:
- Subordinate information: SI:
