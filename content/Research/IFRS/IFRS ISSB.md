International Sustainability Standards Board has published its first standards,
 IFRS S1: General Requirements for sustainability related financial info and IFRS S2: Climate related Disclosures.

Financial information was a critical factor needed for determining whether a company was doing well or not, but off late its necessary but not sufficient for evaluating companies. Aspects such as climate induced risks and depletion of resources are not often known, relationships with stakeholders, communities, people and employees are not often known.


One of the key importance of disclosures is `Transparency`. Transparency ensures that key and vital info. of an organization is known to all its people. Helps in monitoring and mitigating risks.

Stakeholders of Info:
1. Companies: communicate, attract capital and reduce cost of capital, it will also aid the process of decision making.
2. Investors: Helps to determine to go for investment or abstain.

Info. should be complete (faithful representation of all what's happening) and relevant to  the stakeholders.

Usefulness of information is obtained when its relevant and faithfully representative, further it will be enhanced when its comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.

Prior to getting a common international benchmark for reporting key financial info, the entire reporting system was fragmented, different across jurisdictions. In aim to uniform this process and boost in globalization, the IASB (International Accounts Standard Committee) was formed, now (IASB). This bought correct practices across different jurisdictions under on umbrellas to ensure that the financial information is more useful thereof.

The Role of ISSB

The IFRS foundation is prime body under which the ISSB and IASB operate on the three principles of:
1. Public Transparency: any observer may attend the regular meetings of the IFRS.
2. Full and fair consultation: Exposure drafts  and conferences to make org. understand different provisions.
3. Accountability: Does cost benefit analysis and ensures that basis of conclusions is published explaining the rationale for changes.

The Sustainability Disclosure Ecosystem:
IFRS not only writes disclosure but also tries to explain out rationale for such implementation. Thus, trying to make the entire financial ecosystem transparent via such initiative. The ecosystem will include Regulators, Data providers, auditors, and disclosure platforms and software.

Investor focused Reporting VS Multi Stakeholder reporting:
- The ISSB follows a investor focused reporting, while there are some frameworks that follow multi stakeholder reporting, like: European Financial reporting advisory group. (EFRAG) and the GRI framework.

The IFRS always to tries to create a baseline on which additional mandates may be added by different jurisdictions.

Introduction to Sustainability related risks and opportunities
- The objectives dictate what the standard is to do.

A company's sustainability risks and opportunity lies of three basis:
- Industry it operates in
- relationships it relies on to operate
- Resources it uses.

The first step in knowing the sustainability risks the company is exposed to lies in the value chain it has. The value chain is a function of its business model and external environment.

A Business is operating in an interdependent system, with resources it uses and the impact it will face due to such usage. The company's ability to generate cash is depended on the environment it operates in.

Sustainability-related risks:
- disclosures based on its reliance on the below: natural. manufactured, intellectual, human, social and financial resources and relationships.
- they may be called sustainability topics, matters of issues.

The sustainability  risks change by industry to industry, for example:
1. in Real estate, the problem is energy usage for buildings, like AC, heaters, other equipment etc.
2. in Chip man., geo conflicts could be more material than others.

Use this to find risks in various industries [link](https://sasb.ifrs.org/standards/materiality-finder/)
