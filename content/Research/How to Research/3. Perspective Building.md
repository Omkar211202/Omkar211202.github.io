## Building Perspectives

This is how I started building perspectives when I started writing for my paper: "ESG and Stock Returns : A Sectoral Analysis".

So whenever, we start to draw insights, there will generally be 3 view points:
- Positive: favoring your stand.
- Negative: Not in favor of the  stand
- Mixed: They may support both the sides,

The following are few perspectives on doing literature review of few papers.

| Sustainable development, which focuses on environmental protection and societal well being, continues to be a key priority for businesses, regulators, and policymakers (Long et al., 2023).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | For the past several decades, businesses and governments have entirely focused on enhancing consumerism, internationalization, and global industrialization with out considering environmental and societal safety. This has escalated challenges includ ing global warming (Zhang, 2022), resource depletion (Chu & Majumdar, 2012), and enhanced carbon emission (Lee & Min, 2015). | A review of ESG regulatory frameworks in different countries reveals a focus on<br>environmental, social, and governance aspects, with an emphasis on transparency and<br>disclosure (K. H. D. Tang, 2023). |
| Moreover, stock market investors also give due importance to firms committed to environmental and soci etal safety as part of their sustainable development plan (Hu et al., 2022a, 2022b; Sahut & Pasquini-Descomps, 2015).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) reports that in 2020, over 600 ESG rating agencies were active on a global scale. ESG rating divergence occurs when various rating agencies use different methods to measure the ESG performance of the same firm (Chatterji et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2024).                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Moreover, it has been noted that stakeholders increasingly expect businesses to evolve into environmentally sustainable and socially responsible organizations, focusing not only on profit maximization but also on addressing social and environmental concerns (Raimo et al., 2021).                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ESG performance tends to mitigate the likelihood of financial distress (Habib, 2023).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The current increased focus of investors and fund managers on incorporating ESG practices in their asset selection, allocation and diversification of their investment portfolio is called socially responsible investing (SRI) and might capture long-term better returns (Cicireti et al. 2021) or be used as a safe—haven strategy (Rubbaniy et al. 2021) leading companies to follow better corporate governance practices and, in this way, benefit overall the society. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ESG, as a concept, evolved from the earlier<br>model of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to focus on the financial implications of<br>addressing ESG issues (MacNeil & Esser, 2022).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| While CSR aims to make businesses<br>responsible, ESG aims to make their impact measurable (Kaźmierczak, 2022)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
