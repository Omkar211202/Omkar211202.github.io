## What is Graph Rag?
There are any ways in which data may be stored, a typical rag model would store data in a tabular manner, with encodings in one column and text in another. However, Graph Rag is created a RAG with data stored in graph format, with nodes, categories, relationships and properties.

Why Graphs?
Relational Databases have an $O(N)$ , since they transverse to the data based on index, but graphs on the other hand help in faster and more transferal given that the relationships point to memory access.
Finding the drawbacks of SQL, led to the formation NoSQL.

History of Graphs:
- The first graphs was implemented by Euler trying to solve the [Seven bridges of Konigsberg Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg).
- Graphs are typically used for the following cases: Customer insights, network and security, employee, transactions, product, suppliers and process.
