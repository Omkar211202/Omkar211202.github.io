## Why No_Book?
I am a student right now...

Classes get boring as you know...

I kept writing notes in my classwork and threw them away after the year...

To keep me motivated and tech-savvy, I started to use No_Book to make all my notes and keep it as an eternal record of things I read once upon on a time...

Accessible anywhere... everywhere...

> [!caution]
> You need Internet

## Things I do:
- [[Learnings]]: I have to attend my classes...  So Notes here...
- [[Actuarial]]: I have to write exams... So Formulas here...
- [[Miscellaneous]]: Learning is beyond classes... So Lessons here...
- [[The Techie]]: At my heart, Love to be a techie.... So Code here...
