Hey, Great to know you...

I'm  [Omkar Kathi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omkarkathi/), a student @ [SSSIHL](https://www.sssihl.edu.in/). I'm currently doing my [[MBA]] and alongside writing [[Actuarial]] exams from CAS, the US P&C actuarial body.

I love to read, [[Research]] and understand different phenomenon in this world. So, I thought why not make a system that helps me to relearn, revisit and share things I learn. Thus, I built this website.

Do you wanna read something [[Interesting!]] like books about life, spirituality etc. ? There is a section for that.

 [[The Techie]] in me likes to code, making websites, talking about AI, LLM's etc. I also explore things in the intersection of code and physics.

Well, a lots of thoughts are attached to tags, use them to navigate.
