## Activity Based Costing

Pg: 542 M.Y.Khan

### Traditional system and drawbacks:

In the traditional format of costing, the overhead costs were allotted to production centers and they were ascertained to be a proportion of heads like machine hours or labor hrs. etc.

### Limitations of TCS:
1. indirect costs are proportioned to volume, which may not be always true.
2. Proportioning may lead to cost distortion, where tasks are complex in nature.
3. Both large volume and low volume products will be allocated proportions based on volume, where as low vol prod. may occupy more cost

### Activity Based Costing(ABC):
- costs are allocated based on activities in the process  and production heads or cost centers.
- grouped based on Cost Drivers, activities significant towards cost.
- sub-activities will be pooled under a head, that becomes the cost driver.

### Cost Allocation:
- There are two systems:
1. Tracing costs to activities
2. Tracing cost from activities to products.

- selecting cost drivers: Very crucial in the process, choosing them is based on discretion. Choosing a lot of activities may provide accuracy in measurement, but its cumbersome. So activities  that are too detrimental to the production must be chosen.

- Types of Activity Drivers:
1. Transaction: These use the same resources every time.
2. Duration: time consumed in the process is measured as a driver. Eg: direct lab hrs.
3. Intensity: special operations where work is based on quality and intensity deserve different activity subheadings.


### Activity based Management:
