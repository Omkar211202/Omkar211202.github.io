### Comment on the increasing discourse on ESG.

- Yes, ESG is becoming a metric to measure the long term sustainability of a business based out of a broader perspective as compared to the usual statements.
- Capital markets use this score as the parameter of due-diligence to lend credit or invest.
- Cleaner funding like Green bonds, Mutual funds (Sustainable Investing) are growing popular day to day.

### Can ESG be a value-generating growth engine for corporates?

- The traditional measures such as fundamental analysis has focused solely on strong financials, (only quantitative aspects were recorded).

- ESG has become a metric that takes into consideration, several other parameters, such as environment, Governance(stability and dispersed control) and social parameters to get a total score.

- These factors are also significantly important for the sustainability of a business.

### Does ESG mitigate risk? If so, how?

- ESG score is capable of telling in a prospective basis, the strengths and weakness of a company from a broader perspective.

- Poor ESG scores on few pillars of measurement can:

1. ask the company to follow better procedures.
2. ask stakeholders to beware.

- Thus, ESG will ensure long term sustainability of a business.
