## Management Science:

![[Problem Photo.png]]

**Decision Variable** - Also known as variable cells. Here, X1, X2, X3

**Shadow Price**: If the constraint hour is increased by 1 more, then the profit will change by how much ever is mentioned against the respective field. Provided the condition is binding.
	This will work only if the constraint change in hour is withing the allowable increase/ allowable decrease limit.

![[Binding & Not Binding.png]]
**Binding** means that all resources have been used.
**Not Binding** means that all resources have not been used. Therefore there are some slack resources.

**Reduced Cost**: By How much the coefficient of the objective function should increase so that it will get into the solution space. 
	This indicates that if the objective coefficient  is increased by 1, not 2, then my decision (earlier it was 0 in case of chair) will change.
	The "1" under the reduced cost column against "Quantity Chair" indicates that the present objective coefficient is "1" less than the maximum that it can hold under objective coefficient, for which the number in the "Final Value" column against the  "Quantity Chair" will still remain the same (0 in this case)
	**In the Allowable Increase Column**: Here make note that the figures will not be given in decimals. That is to be taken care of. It will show only rounded figures.
	It is the amount by which you have increase the objective function coefficient so that it enters the solution space.

**Allowable Increase**: ***With respect to only the Quantity Chair part*** The value against in this column against *Quantity Chair* shows that by how much should the value in the *Objective Coefficient* against the Quantity Chair should change so that the *Final Value* will change.
	Here care has to be taken that the values mentioned in this column are rounded figures. The actual value in the **Allowable Increase** column is actually 1.1 {for a change in the objective coefficient from 15 by 1.1 increase (16.1) the *final value* will change from 0 to 330). ( maybe subject to changes in quantity of other variable cells}

**Proportionality** and **Divisibility**
Using proportion to find a value against a particular field value.
