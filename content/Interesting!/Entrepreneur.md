## How to Start an Entrepreneurial Revolution:
By: `Danieal J. Isenberg.` 

### Background:
- We can observe that the entrepreneurship plays a critical role in helping the economy grow, and this fact has been realized by all leaders across the Globe.
- However, the best pracs. need not originate from the most developed ones but from the often overlooked ones.

Lets see one awesome story of a small country in the African continent, Rwanda. Generally known for its Wildlife tourism, this country quadrupled its per capita income from 1995. There ease of doing business changed from 143 to 67.  How did they turn around? By growing Coffee and exporting the same.

Chile did by selling fish (Salmon) to US, Israel by manufacturing memory USBs, Iceland by making generic drugs. 

Entrepreneurs can build companies only if the govt. provides the right atmosphere for the same. Well, there is no proper documented theory to promoted venture spirits, but it's an ongoing and continuous learning. This however should not lead to random decision making or avoiding the risks completely.

The author has highlighted 9 Themes for Entrepreneurial Policy for a Revolution to happen.
He emphasizes that an ecosystem consists of leadership, culture, capital markets, and open-minded customers.

Theme 1: ==Stop Emulating the Silicon Valley==
- The silicon valley has become the ideal ecosystem, that the world looks up to. It features google, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple etc. It brings along with it: money, talent (across the world), education (Stanford is near-by), liberal policy to bring in top-talent from all over the world and create a new world.
- Building a Silicon valley needs a top-class education, its a long term prospect to be attainable.
- It also has the top entrepreneurs of the world, coming and establishing themselves in the Santa Clara valley.

Theme 2: ==Shape Ecosystem around Local Conditions==
- be centered around natural resources, geographic location and culture.
- Rwanda focused on creating 72000 ventures focused on coffee, tea and tourism.
- Chile focused on fishing and exports, reducing input costs etc.
- Taiwan used Semi-conductors to grow their economy, set up research for the same. TSMC
- Israel used R&D knowledge and high powered education to bring in place tech start-ups.

Theme 3: ==Engage Pvt. Sector from the start==
- Govt. is known for its inefficiencies, so its better for Individuals to keep the ownership and responsibility. 
- This can be done by removing tapestries for permissions, tax concessions, policy favoring entrepreneurship. 
- Taiwan brought top tech nationals from US to start chip manufacturing. Morris (VP of Texas Inst) started TSMC.
- Liquidate self-holdings of govt to Public sector. Israel did with Yozma, attracting both Local and Global funding.

Theme 4: ==Favor all, not just high Potentials==
- ensure that resources are accessible and usable by all, if possible.
- Micro-finance is centered at this concept, this can help in diversifying the risk of failure.
- Single Entrepreneurs are likely to have more chance to wealth creation, power to inspire etc. unlike employees in large corp.
- Enterprise Ireland and Endeavor are enablers of the same.

Theme 5 : ==Get a win on the Board==
- a success of start-up will inspire many to follow.
- Skype inspired the technical minds in Estonia upon sale to EBAY.
- Baidu in China is an example of the same.
- Celtel, a telecom provider in Africa is an example.
- The Story of Al-Munif is an inspiration to Saudi Arabia population to start-up irrespective of the setting out there.
- Over celebrate success by conducting seminars, award functions etc. on entrepreneurial success

Theme 6: ==Tackle Cultural Change Head on==
- Cultural changes are generally rigid, but they can be broken.
- This include inclination towards Govt jobs or private jobs for stable income, bankruptcy is looked down.
- Success begets success in entrepreneurial journeys.

Theme 7: ==Stress the Roots==
- Do not give money easily to entrepreneurs.
- Test the products in the market conditions before any funding.
- Easy money will not likely lead to success of ventures.
- Incubation necessarily need not mean a successful venture.

Theme 8: ==Don't Overengineer Clusters==
- The term cluster was coined by Michael Porter, concentrations of interconnected companies and resources.
- Do not force a cluster in a place, but ensure it grooms out natural synergies.
- The govt. should ensure that entrepreneurial synergies develop on their own and they should help in developing an ecosystem, rather than forcing it.


Theme 9: ==Reform Legal, Bureaucratic and Regulations==
- The role of govt. to push for softer changes enabling an entrepreneurial society.
- This includes decriminalizing bankruptcy, shielding shareholders from creditors, reducing the latency to start an enterprise.
- Simple Tax regimes and audit to help entrepreneurs.
