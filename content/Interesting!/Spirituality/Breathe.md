## Breathe:

असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम् ।  
अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते ॥ (6.35)

"Its  very difficult to control you mind, this is certain beyond doubt. But, only with the yoga of Practice and Detachment, you can control it."

Krishna was very clear, he said only by ***Practice*** , so what first step in the process of controlling your mind???

Mind wanders from past into the future, this is in fact the cause of stress and anxiety. That's why its important to be in the now. The Now exists only in the breath, its the breath now, you live in, there is no past or future for the breath.

Thus, Breath is the foundation to staying in the now and attaining mind control. To stay in the now, is to be aware and focus on breathing whenever possible.

### Introduction
Let's explore the very sign of life (Breath) and how it defines aspects that can help us attain longevity.

We breath about 500 million times before we die, assuming we live up to 70 years in good health. On an average, a human breathes about 12-20 times in a minute and about 20-23 K breaths in a day. Well, breath is our currency to live on earth. Frankly, the faster we breathe, the faster our lives end.

Lets probably see some examples:
- A strong correlation exists between the breathing rate, metabolic rate, and lifespan across species. Rats breath at about 160-200 breaths per second, thus live only to 2-3 years. Well, breathing is not the only thing that determines lifespan, but also metabolism rates and anti-oxidant system play a role.
- However, all the above are connected to each other largely.

Birds have faster pace of breathing as compared to other animals, however, they live longer lives as they have better anti-oxidant management mechanisms.
Thus, to live longer we have to ensure that we do not ***stress out, our metabolism is slow and smooth, and oxidants are lesser in our body***.

### Emotions and Stress:
In the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, its written:

"चले वाते चलं चित्तं , निश्चले निश्चलं भवेत्":  (2.2)
*When the breath is restless, so is the mind. When the breath is steady, the mind becomes steady.*

"प्राणायामेन संयुक्तः मनः शान्तिं निगच्छति"
Its only with pranayama, we can get peace of mind.

The different states in our body, (called emotions) are caused by particles released by the brain (called hormones). Thus, this keeps us in a reward-punishment mechanism that drives us to do a lots of work, and makes attachment very core to our life. 

Lets understand a biological cycle:
- Lets say you saw a dog: 
  Your Brain senses fear and alerts automatically, this is due to hypothalamus, that is in constant search of danger. So, Hypothalamus tells the pituitary gland, which asks the adrenal gland to release adrenalin and cortisol, and stress signals across the body. Thus, our breathing speeds up as our heart is starts to pump blood at a faster pace. So, body looks for more oxygen, faster inhalation and shorter exhalations. Cortisol, here is the stress hormone, telling the body entirely, this is a stress situation.

However, today we have modern day worries, we are not able to solve largely, causing hypothalamus to send danger signals repeatedly, with no  action however. Thus, stress is getting built up for longer periods. We cannot control anything, be it our heartbeat or mind directly. The only thing we can control is our breath.

Thus, if we control our breath and ensure that we have longer exhalations and slower inhalations, we will able to get away from the HPA (Hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal) cycle. If we constantly monitor our breath and be aware, this cycle may be controlled incase of modern problems leading to less stress and tensions.

### Intelligence and Thinking:
प्राणः प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठितः
Prana (breath/life force) is the foundation of intelligence and consciousness.

When we are in stress, the survival brain takes over. Thus, we cannot think much and fast. For us to think in a logical fashion, we need to pump the Pre-frontal cortex with more oxygen. Thus, if we can breath slowly, with large volume of inhalation, we can push more oxygen into the pre-frontal cortex. Fasting breathing will impact more for the survival brain (HPA), thus cannot help Pre-frontal.

"ततः क्षीयते प्रकाशावरणम्"
Only breath can help us to remove the veil of ignorance and gives us illumination.

### Health and well being:

"प्राणायामात् सर्वरोगक्षयो भवेत्"
- By doing Pranayama, we can remove almost all health issues in our body.

If we ensure that exhalations are longer than inhalations, we can remove more CO2 from our body and ensure that 80% of oxidants exit from our body, giving us a more relaxed and happy body.

### Life and Purpose:
"मन एव मनुष्याणां कारणं बन्धमोक्षयोः": 

- It is the mind that is the cause of slavery and liberation.  The only thing we have to control the mind and the process is by our breath.

### Some Recommended exercises:

At the deeper end are practices like **Śūnyaka** and **Kumbhaka**, which involve intentional suspension or retention of breath. These are generally used during deep meditation or advanced practice, where the aim is not relaxation alone but **deep mental stillness and inner awareness**. By gently suspending or holding the breath without strain, the nervous system becomes highly regulated, CO₂ tolerance improves, and the mind–body connection strengthens. These practices often lead to emotional stability and access to subtler layers of awareness.

**Rechaka**, especially in structured ratios like **3:6:12**, emphasizes a long, slow exhalation. This form of breathing is particularly effective during stress or emotional overload. The extended exhale strongly activates the parasympathetic nervous system, allowing emotional release and producing a profound sense of calm. It is one of the most direct ways to settle the body when the mind feels overwhelmed.

**Anulom Vilom**, or alternate-nostril breathing, is commonly used when emotional balance is needed—such as during anxiety, before sleep, or when the mind feels scattered. By rhythmically inhaling and exhaling through alternate nostrils with a gentle hold in between, this practice helps balance activity between the two hemispheres of the brain, leading to mental clarity, emotional steadiness, and improved focus.

**Bhrāmarī**, the humming breath, is especially useful when the mind is restless, agitated, or angry. The slow exhalation combined with humming creates vibrations that stimulate the vagus nerve and calm the nervous system. This often brings a sense of inner unity, reduced mental noise, and sharper concentration.

For everyday regulation, **Deep Yogic Breathing** forms the foundation. By allowing the belly to expand on inhalation and softening the exhalation, this practice supports emotional stability on a daily basis. It lowers cortisol levels, improves prefrontal cortex functioning (better thinking and self-control), and helps maintain a stable emotional baseline.

In contrast, **Normal or Shallow Breathing** is not a technique but a signal. Short, chest-based breaths typically appear during stress and anxiety, reflecting sympathetic nervous system dominance. Recognizing this pattern is important, as it serves as an early indicator that the body is under strain and needs regulation.

More structured and accessible techniques like **Box Breathing (4–4–4–4)** are highly effective in situations requiring calm focus, such as meetings, exams, or high-pressure moments. By equalizing inhalation, retention, exhalation, and pause, box breathing stabilizes heart rate variability, enhances focus, and restores emotional control. It is especially useful because it can be done anywhere.

**Straw Breathing**, where the exhale is slowed through pursed lips, is particularly helpful during anxiety or panic. By reducing the respiratory rate and extending the exhalation, it sends a strong calming signal to the nervous system, quickly reducing panic responses.

**4–7–8 Breathing** is often used during acute anxiety or racing thoughts. The longer breath hold and extended exhale help quiet nervous arousal and bring rapid calm, making it useful during moments of heightened emotional intensity.

Finally, **Resonance Breathing**, practiced at around five to six breaths per minute, is designed for long-term stress resilience rather than immediate relief. This breathing rate optimizes heart rate variability, strengthens the nervous system’s adaptability, and builds emotional stability over time. It is one of the most evidence-backed practices for long-term regulation.

### Conclusion:
Lets conclude the discussion about Breath (Prana) with a sloka from Bhagavat Gita:

"अपाने जुह्वति प्राणं प्राणेऽपानं तथापरे ।
प्राणापानगती रुद्ध्वा प्राणायामपरायणाः ॥"

Krishna says: Some yogis offer inhalation into exhalation, others exhalation into inhalation. Restraining the movement of inhalation and exhalation, one can become devoted to pranayama.

Just see whom Krishna calls yogis: "The one who have more exhalation" and others "who inhale more than exhale". Thus, in Yoga its important to exhale for longer than inhalation. There are more benefits of long exhalations with regards to diseases. He was teaching medicine 3000 years back.

Thus, 
1. Stable, Slow breathing can regulate emotions and gives you mental stability.
2. Slow Breathing helps you think more and focus.
3. Longer exhalations as compared to inhalation.
