The following is my idea about how habits, mind, thoughts and actions work through the lens of science and logic. This is a summary based on the insights I had sitting in an awareness class, a unique course at my college.
One of the students asked an important question, all of a sudden:

"Is Life is pre-destined or do we have a freewill ?"

The Professor with a thoughtful pause, went straight up to the board and drew the following diagram.

We get a lot of thoughts some mild, some wild but only some of them get into action, while the remaining remain just as thoughts and die as thoughts. Thus, the next fundamental question is:
"What makes a thought see the light as action, and some die in the darkness of the mind?"

Well, the answer is `Intent`. Intent is that belief that tells you why that thought is fundamental to life. If you do not put that thought to action, you probably may feel so bad. Well, the intent convinces one to put thought into action, and is a key component to study.

A repetition of several thoughts day in and day out will lead to one into a habit. However, to become a habit, one needs to be consistent and this action should become very subconscious.

Let me tell you a step by step process of inculcating a habit.  The example used in this scenario is of an individual trying to Spiritual Reading for having a less turbulent mind.

1. Cue: This is a set of environmental aids, which trigger one to get into doing something. For a person looking out to read spirituality, a calm, early morning dim lit cool room and a mat will be best to start. The Time around 6:00 - 6:15 am will be best.
2. Activity: One may truly benefit if he starts off his reading by first using breathing practices to slow down and calm his mind. Silent reading is the best. Read about Breathing practices @ [[Breathe]]
3. Intent: How will this activity benefit me?? How will it help me to reach my goals or aid in the process.
4. Visualization: Just see yourself doing this as envisioned in the above 3 steps.
5. Accountability: Keep a tracker (Digital, Analog or Paper) to monitor your daily practice. A Partner or a person can keep a tab on you to see your progress and consistency.

> [!NOTE]  Relationship between Habit and Subconscious Mind.
> Do you know cycling? Well if you know Cycling, you probably cycle today without consciously thinking right, you probably could hear music, a podcast or talk and pedal. The art of Cycling has become Subconscious to each one of us. How did it all happen? We kept doing it for some time right... Thus, it became our muscle memory to pedal. For anything in life and you have to become a pro in it, it has become subconscious and very natural to you. The time it takes varies from activity to activity.


Why should something become Subconscious?
- If you observe your life, you find you make the most mistakes while you lie in the conscious domain, when you have a choice to do that or do something else. But, when in subconscious, decision making becomes very natural and smooth, because it is in the synapses, the neural linkages.
