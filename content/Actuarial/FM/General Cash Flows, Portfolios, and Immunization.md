## Spot Rates and Forward Rates.

spot rates: annual effective yield rates / interest of zero coupon bonds.

Forward rates are rates that connect to 2 spot rates.

$$
(1+s_5)^5=(1+s_3)^3.(1+f_{3,5})^2
$$
the 5 year old spot rate is the product of three year and 2 year old forward rate.

## Duration

average time cashflows.
Macaulay Duration:
weighted average life of the cash flows.
Macaulay duration:

$$
MacD=\dfrac{\Sigma t.v^t.CF_{t}}{\Sigma v^t.CF_{t}}
$$observations:
1. never Negative
2. 0<MacD< n
3. if CF's are level, they cancel out.
