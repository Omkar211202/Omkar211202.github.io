## Probability functions:
- Discrete:
   probability mass function gives the probability at a particular point.

- Continuous:
   gives the probability between an interval.
   $$
   \int f(x)= p(x)
   $$
common rules:
1. $0 < p(x) < 1$ 
2. $\Sigma p(x) = 1$

## CDF, Survival functions and hazard Functions:

Cumulative distribution function:
1. probability of X such that it does not exceed given value.
2. its the sum of all probabilities till x. its a slack inequality. <=
3. for continuous both slack and strict inequality are the same.

common rules:
1. $F(-\infty) = 0$ 
2. $F(\infty) = 1$

Survival Function:
 The survival function is the complement of the CDF.
 
 Thus, its
 $$
 S(x)=1-P(X<x)= P(X>x)
$$

This is a strict inequality.
1. $S(-\infty) = 1$ 
2. $S(\infty) = 0$

Hazard Function:
known as hazard rate or the force of mortality or failure rate function.

$$
h(x)=\dfrac{f(x)}{S(x)}
$$
